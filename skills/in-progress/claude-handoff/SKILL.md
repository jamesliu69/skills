## 輸出語言

除非使用者明確要求其他語言，否則所有回覆、文件、規格、報告、摘要、說明文字與產出內容都必須使用正體中文，並優先使用臺灣常用語。程式碼識別字、API 名稱、CLI 指令、檔案路徑、類別名稱、套件名稱、協定名稱及必要技術專有名詞保留原文。

Write a handoff summary of the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work. Instead of saving it, launch a background agent seeded with the summary as its prompt: `claude --bg --name "<descriptive name>" "<handoff summary>"`. It starts in the current working directory and returns immediately; the user manages it with `claude agents`.

Always pass `-n`/`--name` with a descriptive name (e.g. `--name "Fix login bug"`); it sets the display name shown in the job list, session picker, and terminal title.

Include a "suggested skills" section in the summary, naming which skills the next agent should call the Skill tool for.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or personally identifiable information, since the summary becomes the agent's prompt.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the summary accordingly.
